## Deliverables

* Van Emde Boas tree supporting basic operations like insertion, deletion, get minimum, get maximum, search.
* Red Black tree supporting basic operations like insertion, deletion and search.
* AVL Tree supporting basic operation like insertion, deletion and search.
* Kruskal implementation using above data structures to compare their performances.

## Project Delivery Plan

* Individually completing data structures.
* Implementing them in separate files.
* Implement Kruskal and compare its running time and memory used while working with different inputs for different data structure used.

## Technologies to be used

* C++ for writing the codes.
* Python for plotting graphs.

## Plan for testing

* Randomly generated graph and then comparison.
* Submitting to some online judge which requires Kruskal implementation to get more accurate results about memory used.

## End User Documentation

* Various Problems on Kruskal's are available online solution can be tested there.
